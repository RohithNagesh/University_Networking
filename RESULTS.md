# CONCLUSION
To improve the campus network, we can use this implementation. We can reduce the load and traffic of switches by creating VLAN. 
To design the network for our campus based on availability of devices we used CISCO Packet Tracer simulator. 
Finally we could send and receive data from host to every other servers.
